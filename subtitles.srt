1
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:40,641
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,243
<i>We've come to arrest her</i>

3
00:00:42,243 --> 00:00:44,078
<i>for the murder of Malva Christie.</i>

4
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,479
<i>Let them both be taken, if you will.</i>

5
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,614
I will travel with them.

6
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,748
Hang her!

7
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:50,384
This isn't justice!

8
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,486
I want to spend my time
with you and Jemmy,

9
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:53,654
just the three of us.

10
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,789
Well, the four of us.

11
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:56,724
Really?

12
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:00,728
- Jamie!
- Claire!

13
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,464
Where are you taking Jamie?

14
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:05,232
That's none of your concern.

15
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,435
What if I want to make
the preaching official?

16
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,336
I heard there's a Presbytery in Edenton.

17
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:12,373
We'll start packing tomorrow
and leave as soon as we can.

18
00:01:12,473 --> 00:01:13,607
Your husband is alive.

19
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:14,608
Trust in God.

20
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:18,145
He will deliver the righteous
out of danger.

21
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,647
You think I'm righteous?

22
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:21,282
I will not leave town.

23
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:18,806
<i>Uncle Jamie?</i>

24
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,410
<i>Uncle Jamie?</i>

25
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:27,548
<i>I canna let
my darkest fears cripple me.</i>

26
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,283
<i>Blood of my blood, bone of my bone,</i>

27
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,887
<i>I gave ye my spirit
till our life shall be done.</i>

28
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,822
<i>And that's why I ken ye're alive still.</i>

29
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:37,625
<i>I'd feel it if you were gone.</i>

30
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:39,360
<i>You live.</i>

31
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:42,196
<i>I ken it in my bones, and I will find you.</i>

32
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:45,666
<i>Horses are watered, Uncle Jamie.</i>

33
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,235
John Quincy and the Cherokee
are away back to the Ridge

34
00:02:48,235 --> 00:02:50,204
to see that all is well, just as ye asked.

35
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,439
And ye're right.

36
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:55,643
We'll attract less attention
in town this way.

37
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,545
Uncle Jamie?

38
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,247
Let's go get my wife.

Sorry. I- I didn't mean to disturb you.

67
00:05:11,345 --> 00:05:12,346
Think nothing of it.

68
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:14,815
Did he give you money?

69
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:16,350
Yes, a bit.

70
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:19,019
Well, call the old bizzom

71
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,021
and send for some Holland, why don't you?

72
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:21,922
Who?

73
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,891
Mrs. Tolliver?

74
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,826
Mrs. Tolliver!

75
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,595
Really, Mrs. Ferguson,

76
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,431
you are the most dreadful nuisance.

77
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,866
I was just coming to pay my respects

78
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,535
to Mrs. Fraser in any case.

79
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:37,337
Mrs. Fraser, I am Mrs. Tolliver.

80
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,708
- Mrs. Tolliver.
- I'm to see to your welfare

81
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,009
and acquaint you with our custom.

82
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:44,645
You will receive one meal each day,

83
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,915
unless you wish to send
to the ordinary for more,

84
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,016
at your own expense.

85
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:51,585
<i>I will bring a basin
for washing once a day,</i>

86
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,521
<i>and you will carry your own slops.</i>

87
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,724
Stuff your custom, Maisie.
She has some money.

88
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,959
Fetch us a bottle of geneva.
There's a good girl.

89
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,361
<i>Then if you must,
you can tell her what's what.</i>

90
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,032
A shilling, then.

91
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:09,770
<i>You've missed supper,
but as you've just come,</i>

92
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:12,072
I'll make an allowance
and bring you something.

93
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:14,975
Thank you. I'm famished.

94
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
None for me, thanks.

95
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,512
Just the gin.

96
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:21,148
Please, could you get a word to my family?

97
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,884
That I cannot do. I'm sorry.

98
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,552
<i>Fraser, she said.</i>

99
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:27,721
<i>You aren't the, uh...</i>

100
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:29,156
...murderess?

101
00:06:29,456 --> 00:06:30,891
I don't want to talk about it.

102
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,459
<i>As you like.</i>

103
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,394
<i>Welcome to your new home, then.</i>

104
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,630
Used to be a slaughterhouse, they say.

105
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:38,899
Seems about right.

106
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:41,001
It's grand here, it is.

107
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:42,669
Sit, sit.

108
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,072
<i>You must be bone tired.</i>

109
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,007
I'm Sadie, by the bye.

110
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,712
- Claire.
- <i>You, uh...</i>

111
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:53,413
any good at cards, Claire?

112
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:55,682
Know a game called Brag?

113
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:57,885
Let me guess.

114
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,454
You're in here for cheating at cards.

115
00:07:00,554 --> 00:07:01,488
Cheat?

116
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:02,890
Sadie Ferguson?

117
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,591
Not a bit of it.

118
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,161
Forgery.

119
00:07:11,832 --> 00:07:13,567
All right then, but not for money.

120
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:15,669
Hmm.

121
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:18,472
We'll play for beans then, shall we?

122
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,642
How long have you been in here?

123
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,843
A month, almost.

124
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:24,978
29 days, by last count.

125
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,848
You haven't had a trial yet?

126
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:29,016
<i>No, praise God.</i>

127
00:07:30,083 --> 00:07:32,853
<i>Hasn't been anybody
tried in the last two months.</i>

128
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,621
Maisie says the court's shut down,

129
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:36,924
all the justices gone into hiding.

130
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:38,592
<i>So here too, then?</i>

131
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,460
<i>Well, I wouldn't be
in a hurry, dearie.</i>

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,863
If they've not tried you,
they can't hang you.

133
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:44,765
- I am innocent.
- <i>'Course you are.</i>

134
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,833
You stick to it.

135
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,734
Don't let 'em bully-whack you
into admitting

136
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:48,902
the least little thing.

137
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:51,839
I won't.

138
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,976
But I don't want to languish
here in jail either.

139
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,544
<i>If the courts aren't open now--</i>

140
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,947
One who should worry about
hanging's the sheriff.

141
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,616
What I hear, a mob's liable to come here

142
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:04,952
and string him up if he don't look sharp.

143
00:08:04,952 --> 00:08:06,153
<i>There's unrest in the streets,</i>

144
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,054
<i>if you hadn't noticed.</i>

145
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,956
The rebels have made it hell

146
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:09,857
for any loyal subject.

147
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,662
What ails you, Mistress?

148
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,899
<i>I could not tell her what it was.</i>

149
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,500
<i>Could not say that I knew</i>

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,236
<i>just how long this war would last,</i>

151
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,104
<i>that the courts would likely remain closed</i>

152
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,038
<i>for years to come,</i>

153
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,774
<i>and we would languish here without rescue.</i>

154
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:43,991
It feels like I'm throwing you
to the wolves.

155
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,693
I think they're more commonly
known as wives.

156
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,262
Same difference.

157
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,101
Are you gonna be okay
with Reverend McMillan?

158
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,537
Surely I can handle ministering
to a few soldiers.

159
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:00,540
I'm a veteran myself now, sort of.

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,810
And I'm tough.

161
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:06,280
I had my wayward youth.

162
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,815
Smoking, drinking beer.

163
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:10,884
Wow.

164
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,886
Stealing sweeties from the post office.

165
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,888
Quite the wee criminal for a while.

166
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:17,991
The terror of Inverness.

167
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:20,027
Son of a preacher man.

168
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,262
Still, I think Reverend McMillan wants

169
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,196
to test my mettle,

170
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:25,599
make sure I'm not too focused

171
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,901
on the lofty, intellectual
parts of my studies.

172
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,104
What is it?

173
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,341
There's something written
all over your face.

174
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,244
What do you even say to a preacher?

175
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:38,979
"Break a leg" doesn't seem right.

176
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,615
"God luck"?

177
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,652
Good day to you both.

178
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,322
Thank you, Mistress MacKenzie,

179
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:50,891
for your willingness to assist
with the almsgiving,

180
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,660
especially since you'll only be
with us for a few weeks.

181
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:55,595
Of course.

182
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,031
Are you ready, Mr. MacKenzie?

183
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,233
The soldiers we'll encounter today

184
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,702
are mustering to go north.

185
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,972
Now, it's not for us to judge

186
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,309
which side they have chosen to fight for,

187
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:13,013
but know that they'll be
in need of much prayer

188
00:10:14,348 --> 00:10:15,315
and supplication.

189
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:50,417
Good day, young one.

190
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,986
Could we offer you some comfort

191
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,187
through the word of God?

192
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:58,125
The future Reverend MacKenzie
was at the Battle of Alamance.

193
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,794
Doin' what, exactly?

194
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,764
Carryin' the white flag of surrender?

195
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:07,734
<i>Bible verse ain't gonna help us.</i>

196
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,670
<i>Knowin' how to wield a knife,
use our fists, maybe.</i>

197
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,340
There's nothin'
in your holy book about that.

198
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:18,445
What advice can these
devil-dodgers give us, eh?

199
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,355
"Float like a butterfly.

200
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,690
Sting like a bee."

201
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,094
And God will surely go with thee.

202
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,363
Ali.

203
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,477
What did you just say?

204
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:51,978
Muhammad Ali.

205
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,149
You're a traveler, aren't you, like me?

206
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,452
You gotta help me.

207
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,088
Who are you?

208
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:02,756
Wendigo Donner.

209
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,926
You were one of Lionel Brown's men.

210
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:07,194
Claire Fraser told me--

211
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:07,994
I didn't do nothing to her, okay?

212
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:08,895
I swear.

213
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:10,831
I was gonna help her get away.

214
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:11,431
Didn't she tell you?

215
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,968
Why would I hurt her?

216
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:16,937
She's like us, isn't she?

217
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,843
I was conscripted from jail,
but I'm not a thief, okay?

218
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:25,178
I just needed a gemstone
to get back to my own time.

219
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,447
I've still got it, but I'm stuck here.

220
00:12:29,349 --> 00:12:31,751
I came back to help
the Indian Nations, but...

221
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,087
Well, Claire did tell me that.

222
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,124
The plan just got all screwed up.

223
00:12:38,859 --> 00:12:40,961
Five of us made it
to the stones at Ocracoke,

224
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,796
but we got split up when we went through.

225
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,364
I don't know what happened.

226
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:45,465
I never saw them again.

227
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:50,103
I never even made it
to where I was supposed to go.

228
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,206
Look, I don't wanna hurt anybody.

229
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,076
I just wanna go home.

230
00:12:58,478 --> 00:12:59,913
You get that, right?

231
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:03,950
Please... help me.

232
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,138
Sun's barely up,
and look at the state of Tolly,

233
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,942
while we're here slaving away
at the arse-crack of dawn.

234
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:33,013
Well, she's breathing fine,

235
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,582
though a glass of water wouldn't hurt.

236
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,552
I doubt she'd drink it
if there's no gin in it.

237
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:39,553
Open it.

238
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,223
Ye gods and little fishes.
Here we are, Margit.

239
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,324
<i>Who's this now?</i>

240
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,196
Which is the healer?

241
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:52,432
That would be me.

242
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,502
What is she charged with?

243
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,204
Well, one of 'em's a forger,

244
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,238
a few of them are thieves,

245
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,906
and one of them's a murderess.

246
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,042
Fletcher, Ferguson-- somethin' like that.

247
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:03,577
But as to which one being which...

248
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,879
You mean to say you don't know?

249
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,415
I'm paid to guard 'em,
not hobnob with 'em.

250
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:11,051
- I'm the murderess.
- Sadie.

251
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:13,186
Very well.

252
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:14,087
Come with me.

253
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:17,857
Well, where are we going?

254
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,894
I'm afraid we're in a hurry, madam.

255
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:53,927
Mr. Christie!

256
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,495
I'm glad to see ye kept yer word.

257
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,230
- Where is Claire?
- She's gone.

258
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,300
You were supposed to keep watch!

259
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,435
The guards wouldn't allow me
to stand out here all night.

260
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,471
When I came back this morning,
it was already too late.

261
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,239
I did everything in my power.

262
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,342
The sheriff assured me
they'd treat her with dignity.

263
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:21,087
They're saying
that Auntie Claire was taken.

264
00:15:21,354 --> 00:15:22,622
Was it that bastard, Brown?

265
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:24,991
No, no, it was soldiers
looking for a healer.

266
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,128
Where was she taken?

267
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,963
They couldna tell me.

268
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,032
Could not or would not?

269
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,167
Got any drink, have you, sir?

270
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,436
Or a few bob to pay for some?

271
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:40,340
<i>Drop of something for my poor old throat.</i>

272
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,084
Tell me what you know.

273
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,487
A shilling more and we'll make it

274
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,256
a wee dram or two instead, shall we?

275
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,058
Nice lady.

276
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,326
Did my best to help her.

277
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,063
If anything, you probably ought
to be thanking me.

278
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,431
If you truly want to help,

279
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,200
then tell me what you know, please.

280
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,735
She told 'em your wife was a forger

281
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:12,205
and tried to claim
the murder charge for herself.

282
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,040
<i>Oh, no pardon possible for forgery.</i>

283
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,142
<i>Capital crime.</i>

284
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,711
But as for murder,

285
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:21,748
she probably thinks
she can plead the Good Book,

286
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,384
<i>repent for her sins,
and get off scot-free.</i>

287
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,719
<i>Don't be daft.</i>

288
00:16:25,719 --> 00:16:26,619
<i>You're living in fairy world</i>

289
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,355
if you think I'd get away with that.

290
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,756
I was trying to help her.

291
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,657
Enough.

292
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:33,226
You'd better thank the Lord
that that guard is watching.

293
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:35,295
Now tell me! Where did they take my wife?

294
00:16:35,295 --> 00:16:36,629
How the bleedin' hell should I know?

295
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,098
It's Tolly you want to ask.

296
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,533
Mrs. Tolliver's the sheriff's wife.

297
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,371
<i>She was as drunk as a lord
when those men came.</i>

298
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:46,606
I'm not even sure both
of 'em were soldiers as such.

299
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,375
What did they look like, these men?

300
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,576
How would I know?

301
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,444
They all look the same to me.

302
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:56,149
What's going on here?

303
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,250
Are you Mrs. Tolliver?

304
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:58,518
I'm James Fraser.

305
00:16:59,652 --> 00:17:01,621
I demand to know where my wife was taken.

306
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:05,058
All I know is she was taken
on my husband's orders.

307
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,026
A matter of duty to the Crown.

308
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,495
And where is he, your husband?

309
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:12,565
Do you think I'm privy to such information,

310
00:17:13,266 --> 00:17:14,200
merely his wife?

311
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:18,104
He'd gone to quell some unrest,

312
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,073
rebels passing through

313
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,108
on their way to take Fort Johnston.

314
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:25,278
He's likely drinking
his own sorrows away by now.

315
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:27,781
Please go!

316
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:57,310
<i>Come in.</i>

317
00:18:02,482 --> 00:18:03,683
<i>Who the devil is this?</i>

318
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,385
Healer, ma'am. Midwife.

319
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,554
<i>A Mistress Fraser.</i>

320
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,356
I'm told there's not
a single midwife to be found

321
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:11,424
in the entire county.

322
00:18:12,158 --> 00:18:13,460
Where did you find her?

323
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,161
<i>The workhouse or the local jail?</i>

324
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,197
Jail, actually.

325
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,868
But, uh, since the ship's surgeon

326
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:25,538
is apparently in Fort Johnston
tending soldiers,

327
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:28,875
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

328
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:30,109
God.

329
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,312
We're not that desperate yet, are we?

330
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,680
Plucked from a jail.

331
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,383
Imagine a governor driven
out of his palace

332
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,621
and forced to flee for his life.

333
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,457
My husband hunted
by mobs of his own citizens.

334
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,561
Marooned on this blasted ship

335
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:50,797
when everything's going to hell.

336
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,802
I'm sorry we're not meeting
under better circumstances.

337
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,905
But since your husband did send for me...

338
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,508
may I examine you?

339
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:04,410
I can help. I promise.

340
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:18,358
Have you been experiencing
any cramping, bleeding,

341
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,693
intermittent pain in your back?

342
00:19:20,793 --> 00:19:21,728
No.

343
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,764
And how long have you been ill?

344
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:26,833
I've been vomiting all night

345
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,535
and sweated through the sheets.

346
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,404
Oh, I look positively ghastly.

347
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,941
Perhaps I'll take one of my tonics.

348
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,746
Are you taking all of these
tonics at once, Mrs. Martin?

349
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:41,681
One at breakfast,
another after luncheon.

350
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,249
When the fever comes on,

351
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,817
I use the East Indian Chaulmoogra.

352
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:48,922
Perhaps we can find you

353
00:19:48,922 --> 00:19:50,390
something more suitable.

354
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:52,692
What if it's the tertian ague?

355
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,460
It's not.

356
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,430
Shouldn't you be letting my blood?

357
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,899
There's a fleam and bowl over there.

358
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,267
Unless...

359
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,703
Oh, God, is it true?

360
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,305
Are you the one who...

361
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,775
who murdered her husband's
pregnant mistress

362
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:11,511
<i>and cut the baby from her womb?</i>

363
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:12,779
It was you, wasn't it?

364
00:20:14,614 --> 00:20:15,815
She was not his mistress.

365
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,418
And I didn't kill her.

366
00:20:18,651 --> 00:20:19,686
<i>As for the rest...</i>

367
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,854
My husband doesn't know, does he?

368
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,557
I doubt it.

369
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:26,526
<i>How did you hear?</i>

370
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,628
Oh, you are quite notorious.

371
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:30,797
The talk of the town.

372
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,000
<i>Of course, my husband has
no time for gossip</i>

373
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,903
<i>and has no memory for names, as I do.</i>

374
00:20:38,972 --> 00:20:40,840
I've never known a murderess before.

375
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,609
I'm not a murderess.

376
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,812
<i>Well, of course, you'd say so.</i>

377
00:20:45,812 --> 00:20:47,013
You don't look depraved.

378
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:51,484
Though I must say, you don't
look quite respectable either.

379
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:55,688
It's ginger tea.

380
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:57,423
It will help with the nausea.

381
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,994
Not until you swear
you won't hurt my baby.

382
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,328
<i>You must swear it.</i>

383
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,564
Mrs. Martin... of course.

384
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:10,269
Your husband brought me here
because I'm a healer.

385
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,038
<i>Harming someone would be rather</i>

386
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,707
<i>at cross purposes with that, wouldn't it?</i>

387
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,442
You need fluids,

388
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,045
for your own sake and for the baby.

389
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:30,990
Six children I've had,

390
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:33,726
and I've lost three of them.

391
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:36,562
I'd rather die than lose another

392
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,398
<i>and break my husband's heart.</i>

393
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:39,599
<i>He won't bear it.</i>

394
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:41,534
You're in no danger of that.

395
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,404
I'd say you've eaten something

396
00:21:44,704 --> 00:21:45,772
that strongly disagrees with you.

397
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:46,639
That's all.

398
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,309
I am a mother too.

399
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,415
Let's settle you into your cabin.

400
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:58,484
And I'll go ask your husband

401
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:00,920
to send for some different medicine.

402
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,388
Thank you.

403
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,527
I won't say anything
about the charge if you don't.

404
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,634
<i>Right.</i>

405
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:16,469
I'll see you later then.

406
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,838
Bye.

407
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,339
Whoa, what's all this?

408
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,377
Gosh, there's enough food
in here to last three days.

409
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,080
Are you leaving me?

410
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:28,748
It's nothing. Snacks.

411
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:30,883
And a farrier's hammer?

412
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:36,723
You're going back to hand out
theological pamphlets.

413
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,391
I didn't realize shoeing horses

414
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,926
was part of the job description.

415
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:41,761
Ministering to animals now as well?

416
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,667
That's for Wendigo Donner, isn't it?

417
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,504
You're gonna try to help him escape?

418
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,740
Roger, what are you gonna do?

419
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,608
Singlehandedly bust him out of the army?

420
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,609
Shh...

421
00:22:57,677 --> 00:22:59,846
You're not Steve McQueen
in <i>The Great Escape.</i>

422
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,714
You're studying to be
a minister, for God's sake!

423
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:02,782
I know that.

424
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,450
I just...

425
00:23:05,685 --> 00:23:07,086
I thought maybe I would put in
a good word for him

426
00:23:07,086 --> 00:23:08,921
with the officers or... something.

427
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,594
- After what he did?
- Oh, but that's just it.

428
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:15,828
According to Claire,
he didn't do anything.

429
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:16,896
Right.

430
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,165
He just stood by and did nothing

431
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,869
while my mother was brutally attacked.

432
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,704
And then he ran and hid like a coward.

433
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:29,709
What could he have done without
getting killed himself?

434
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:31,544
You--you didn't see him, Bree.

435
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,945
He--he's desperate, scared.

436
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:36,849
He just wants to go home.

437
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,553
He--he came back here
to help his fellow Indians,

438
00:23:40,553 --> 00:23:41,888
and everything went to shit.

439
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,690
He was just trying to survive.

440
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:47,727
When I came through the stones,

441
00:23:47,727 --> 00:23:49,028
I ended up on Bonnet's crew.

442
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,165
I did what I had to.

443
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,469
And I would've done anything to find you.

444
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:58,504
Anything.

445
00:23:58,604 --> 00:23:59,572
No. No.

446
00:24:00,873 --> 00:24:02,475
You would never, ever stand by

447
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,611
and watch a woman be hurt,

448
00:24:05,711 --> 00:24:06,846
not like those men did

449
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,549
in that tavern that night
when I came back,

450
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,117
and not like Wendigo did with Mama.

451
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:16,556
I watched Bonnet...

452
00:24:18,191 --> 00:24:20,159
throw a child overboard on that ship...

453
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,865
...and her mother jump in after her.

454
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:32,171
And though I was desperate
to intervene, I was frozen.

455
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,974
I wanted to save them, but I couldn't.

456
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,911
I had to fight every instinct in me,

457
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,515
because I had to stay alive to find you.

458
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:45,852
I was outnumbered.

459
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:49,155
Bonnet and his crew would have killed me.

460
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,224
And it was the same for Wendigo.

461
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,727
So how can I condemn him,

462
00:24:56,262 --> 00:24:57,630
as a man or as a minister?

463
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,837
- Yeah, Roger...
- Bree.

464
00:25:17,216 --> 00:25:18,851
<i>We'll be ready, Lieutenant Tate.</i>

465
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,020
<i>Catch a steady wind.
Go up the Cape Fear a bit.</i>

466
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,790
Send raiding parties to shore,
and take back Fort Johnston.

467
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,894
With respect, Your Excellency,

468
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:29,161
if I may speak frankly,

469
00:25:30,062 --> 00:25:32,164
you can't mean to try
and attack in this fog.

470
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,300
This is hardly the ship for it.

471
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,236
- And the Captain says--
- We have to do something, Tate.

472
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,171
Do you have any idea what fate awaits me

473
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:41,607
if I lose this wretched colony?

474
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:43,009
<i>The Redcoats will hang me</i>

475
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,977
before the goddamned rebels do.

476
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:46,946
<i>We should have news imminently.</i>

477
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:49,248
<i>But the rebels are far more numerous</i>

478
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,950
<i>and better armed than expected.</i>

479
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,686
And if they are holding
Fort Johnston, sir,

480
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,689
then for your own sake
and the sake of your family,

481
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:59,191
<i>perhaps you might consider sailing north.</i>

482
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,261
Forgive me...

483
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:07,333
...but surely, your place
is here, Governor Martin.

484
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,702
And yours, madam,
is in the surgeon's cabin,

485
00:26:09,969 --> 00:26:10,937
tending to my wife.

486
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,041
Well, her condition is much improved.

487
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,742
I wanted to ask if I could go fetch

488
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,913
some additional supplies
in Wilmington for her.

489
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,081
Leave the ship?

490
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,817
Do you have any idea
what it took to bring you here?

491
00:26:24,817 --> 00:26:25,751
Absolutely not.

492
00:26:26,886 --> 00:26:29,855
But your wife's continued
good health may depend on it.

493
00:26:29,855 --> 00:26:31,924
<i>Ahoy there.</i>

494
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,225
<i>We're coming aboard,
by your leave,</i>

495
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:34,827
<i>in the name of King George's Army.</i>

496
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:35,895
Please, Your Excellency,

497
00:26:35,895 --> 00:26:36,796
I...

498
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,131
I just need to get some extra supplies.

499
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,934
Make a list, and we'll send a messenger

500
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,003
to collect whatever it is
you need before we set sail.

501
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:44,937
Be quick about it.

502
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,606
I don't imagine we'll be
in these waters much longer,

503
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:48,374
no matter what happens.

504
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:52,044
But when can I expect to return to shore?

505
00:26:52,144 --> 00:26:54,013
It can't have escaped your notice

506
00:26:54,714 --> 00:26:55,982
that my wife is with child.

507
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:58,784
She'll require your assistance.

508
00:26:58,784 --> 00:26:59,986
You will remain on the ship

509
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,287
<i>for the duration of our voyage.</i>

510
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,022
<i>Consider it your patriotic duty.</i>

511
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,191
<i>Lieutenant Tate will convey
your letter to shore at once.</i>

512
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,625
Won't take long.

513
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,960
What news, Major MacDonald?

514
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,263
We've lost Fort Johnston, sir.

515
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:13,866
It's certain, then?

516
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:18,170
Fancy meeting you here.

517
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,140
You know her?

518
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:22,708
We've met.

519
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:23,809
<i>We most certainly have.</i>

520
00:27:23,909 --> 00:27:25,411
Although last I heard,

521
00:27:25,711 --> 00:27:26,412
- you were--
- Fully intent

522
00:27:26,412 --> 00:27:27,813
on proving my innocence.

523
00:27:28,748 --> 00:27:29,749
Thank you, Major.

524
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:33,753
<i>Well, before
you two become reacquainted,</i>

525
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:34,920
once you've given your letter to Tate,

526
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,088
could you fetch me something

527
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:37,823
to ease the griping in my stomach?

528
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,926
A splash of brandy in it
couldn't hurt either.

529
00:27:46,932 --> 00:27:48,267
Redcoats in the whorehouse.

530
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,069
We might be able to get
something out of them.

531
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,037
Aye.

532
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,039
They might know where the sheriff is

533
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,807
or where he's taken Auntie Claire.

534
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,823
<i>We can rally
Loyalists, find more troops.</i>

535
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,426
Your servant, madam.

536
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,197
I couldn't quite believe
my ears when I heard

537
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:20,166
that you'd been arrested for murder...

538
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,335
...and- and that the girl's
father had accompanied you

539
00:28:23,335 --> 00:28:24,737
to Wilmington with the express wish

540
00:28:24,737 --> 00:28:25,471
of seeing you hanged.

541
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,743
He only wished to ensure
that I received a fair trial.

542
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,378
Of course.

543
00:28:33,412 --> 00:28:35,781
If you're here
in such illustrious company,

544
00:28:36,315 --> 00:28:38,317
then I- I'm sure
that all must be in order.

545
00:28:39,452 --> 00:28:41,720
<i>I assume this means that
your husband has seen sense</i>

546
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,390
<i>and finally declared himself
for the Crown, Mrs. Fraser?</i>

547
00:28:46,292 --> 00:28:48,294
You doubt this man's allegiance, Major?

548
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,262
Well, it's only that I assumed,

549
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,864
since the good lady's husband

550
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,166
resigned from his position
as Indian agent,

551
00:28:54,166 --> 00:28:56,035
<i>among other things, that they, uh...</i>

552
00:28:56,469 --> 00:28:58,804
How to put this politely...

553
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,107
Your husband is James Fraser
of Fraser's Ridge?

554
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:03,476
Yes. Yes, he is.

555
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:07,046
I do, of course,
very much hope

556
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,013
that we can count on

557
00:29:08,814 --> 00:29:10,516
Mr. Fraser's support in our endeavors,

558
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,884
but there is some doubt,

559
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:14,987
certainly, as to the Frasers' integrity,

560
00:29:16,188 --> 00:29:17,256
<i>- as you can see.</i>
- How dare you.

561
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:19,024
Could you excuse us, Major?

562
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:20,493
Certainly, your Excellency.

563
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,805
Manipulative bastard.

564
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,789
- Mr. Thomas Christie?
- Yes?

565
00:29:51,524 --> 00:29:53,125
A Mistress Claire Fraser

566
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,861
requires your immediate
and most urgent assistance.

567
00:29:57,263 --> 00:29:59,899
She has assured us that you
are the man best able to help.

568
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,368
But we require your utmost discretion.

569
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,506
You can procure the necessary items,

570
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:08,407
Mr. Christie?

571
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,209
Items?

572
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,178
Yes, of course.

573
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,213
Of course, yes.

574
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,249
For her patient aboard HMS <i>Cruizer.</i>

575
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,921
I am--I'm very happy to be of service

576
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:23,088
both to Mistress Fraser

577
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:24,957
and to the Crown.

578
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:27,893
And you will see that she has enclosed

579
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:29,061
a list of what is needed.

580
00:30:29,528 --> 00:30:31,463
Now, please bring everything to the harbor

581
00:30:31,463 --> 00:30:33,065
at your earliest convenience.

582
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,833
The ship, it's in the harbor?

583
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:37,403
No, sir.

584
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,973
But I will wait for you there
and convey whatever you bring,

585
00:30:40,973 --> 00:30:42,174
by boat, back to the ship.

586
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:43,409
But please hurry.

587
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,278
The <i>Cruizer</i> will not be
at anchor for long.

588
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,557
<i>Vir meus...</i>

589
00:31:13,939 --> 00:31:16,108
Sheriff Tolliver
orchestrated my being here,

590
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:18,043
so I assumed you knew what my charge was

591
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,945
and you were turning a blind eye.

592
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:21,647
Mistress Martin certainly did.

593
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,449
There is that rather insignificant matter

594
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:25,184
of trying to govern a royal colony

595
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,919
from a goddamned floating dungeon

596
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:28,354
that's been occupying my time.

597
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:31,323
<i>The crew told me you were
a healer coming from the jail.</i>

598
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,225
I had neither the time nor inclination

599
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:35,160
to ask for any of the unsavory details.

600
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,396
Exactly my point.

601
00:31:37,396 --> 00:31:39,932
You didn't care what I'd done
when you sent for me.

602
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:42,134
You needed my help, and I gave it.

603
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,136
But a murderess, it's unthinkable.

604
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,671
I swear to you, I'm innocent.

605
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:51,176
I found the young woman
in question already dead.

606
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:52,945
But she was with child, so I--

607
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,446
God in heaven, it gets worse and worse.

608
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,182
My poor wife, does she know
about all of this sorry tale?

609
00:31:57,182 --> 00:31:58,550
You don't understand.

610
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,653
I did what I could to save
that unborn child.

611
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:05,424
And I will do everything I can
for your wife and your baby.

612
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:10,929
Your wife told me

613
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,633
that you'd both suffered terrible losses.

614
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:17,303
<i>I know what it's like to lose a child.</i>

615
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:20,372
There is no greater pain.

616
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,674
<i>It's unspeakable.</i>

617
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,211
My three beautiful boys.

618
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:31,383
Sam, my youngest...

619
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,021
Sometimes I think I glimpse him
running past.

620
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,992
He was only eight years old.

621
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:41,994
I'm so sorry.

622
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,664
Yes, perhaps you should be,

623
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,366
<i>you and your husband both,</i>

624
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:50,736
because the only thing more
painful than losing my sons

625
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:53,639
is knowing that
my three daughters will grow up

626
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,407
in a world that exists without them,

627
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:57,609
without the men they would have become,

628
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,244
<i>men who would have protected them</i>

629
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,447
<i>from those who choose violence
and bloodshed,</i>

630
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,315
<i>chaos and anarchy over law and order,</i>

631
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,585
those who would betray
their nation and choose war.

632
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:08,587
But surely, no one enters war willingly,

633
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,658
no matter one's personal convictions.

634
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,427
And what exactly are you
and your husband's convictions,

635
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:16,428
Mistress Fraser?

636
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,597
To be charged with murder is one thing,

637
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,768
but to be suspected of treason
is quite another.

638
00:33:29,375 --> 00:33:30,576
That was disappointing.

639
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:33,312
Maybe we'll have better luck
at the Old Bell.

640
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,383
Mr. Fraser.

641
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,319
What is it now, Mr. Christie?

642
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:42,121
I know where Mistress Fraser is.

643
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,726
Read it.

644
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,496
She's on a ship, the <i>Cruizer.</i>

645
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:51,697
She wants you to go to her.

646
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:53,699
<i>Vir meus,</i> my husband.

647
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:56,235
She wants you.

648
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:17,523
Lieutenant Tate.

649
00:34:17,523 --> 00:34:19,057
Back down below, please, madam.

650
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,160
I just need some extra blankets
for Mrs. Martin.

651
00:34:25,464 --> 00:34:26,398
Boat, ahoy!

652
00:34:38,143 --> 00:34:39,411
<i>Do you wish to come aboard, sir?</i>

653
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,312
Aye, I do.

654
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:41,847
By whose authority?

655
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,283
<i>I am a former Indian agent</i>

656
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:45,784
<i>in the governor's employ</i>

657
00:34:45,784 --> 00:34:47,152
and an acquaintance...

658
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,590
...of Lord John Grey.

659
00:34:58,464 --> 00:34:59,364
Sassenach.

660
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,143
<i>Excuse me.</i>

661
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,345
This is not permitted.

662
00:35:16,582 --> 00:35:17,716
I wish to speak with the governor.

663
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,785
<i>I'm James Fraser of Fraser's Ridge.</i>

664
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,687
I've come for my wife.

665
00:35:22,721 --> 00:35:25,123
I humbly ask that you allow me
to take her home.

666
00:35:25,491 --> 00:35:27,292
I regret to inform you, sir,

667
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:29,294
that your wife is a prisoner of the Crown,

668
00:35:30,696 --> 00:35:32,631
though perhaps you were aware of this.

669
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:36,635
It is true, is it not,
that you have declared

670
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:39,505
martial law over the colony
of North Carolina?

671
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:41,640
It is.

672
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,275
Then you alone have control

673
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:44,843
over the custody of any prisoners.

674
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,180
My wife is in your custody.

675
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,748
You have the power to release her.

676
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,850
The crime of which
your wife stands accused

677
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,585
is most heinous.

678
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:55,854
There is no merit to the charge.

679
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:02,861
Surely, having made her acquaintance,

680
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,696
you'll have drawn your own conclusions

681
00:36:04,696 --> 00:36:05,564
as to her character.

682
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,332
And what conclusions should I draw

683
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,267
as to your character?

684
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,668
Lord John Grey assured me

685
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:11,803
that you were a man to be counted upon,

686
00:36:11,803 --> 00:36:14,673
- but Major MacDonald said--
- Major MacDonald?

687
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,375
My resignation as Indian agent?

688
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,945
Surely, that is all behind us.

689
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,347
Your unwillingness to elaborate
further on the matter

690
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,415
speaks volumes, sir.

691
00:36:29,621 --> 00:36:31,924
I understand
Your Excellency's reservations.

692
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,762
Perhaps some surety may be offered.

693
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:39,598
You have the impertinence
to try and bribe me?

694
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:40,899
That was not my intent, sir.

695
00:36:41,767 --> 00:36:44,870
What I offer is a bond against
my wife's appearance in court.

696
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,272
No, sir, I will not accept
a bond for your wife.

697
00:36:47,806 --> 00:36:49,608
<i>I should hang the two of you out of hand,</i>

698
00:36:49,608 --> 00:36:50,909
have you swinging from the yardarm.

699
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,344
Your Excellency, please.

700
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:01,219
I'm a reasonable man.

701
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,355
<i>I will offer you a proposition.</i>

702
00:37:03,355 --> 00:37:04,590
<i>Return to the backcountry</i>

703
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,291
<i>and gather such men as you can.</i>

704
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:07,926
Then report to Major MacDonald

705
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,828
and commit your troops to his campaign.

706
00:37:10,796 --> 00:37:13,565
<i>When I receive word from him
that you have, say, 200 men,</i>

707
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,868
then, sir, I will release
your wife to you.

708
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:24,276
Very well.

709
00:37:35,787 --> 00:37:36,822
Be still, <i>a nighean.</i>

710
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:39,725
Do not despair.

711
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,427
I will see you when the morning comes.

712
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:18,330
<i>Excuse me, Miss.</i>

713
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,799
Do you have a moment to talk

714
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,368
about someone who loves you very much?

715
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:28,340
I don't have time to talk about God today.

716
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,307
Thanks anyway.

717
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:33,011
I was talking about your husband.

718
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,014
<i>Do you have any time for him?</i>

719
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:37,983
Always.

720
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,988
But he's been kinda busy
ministering to some soldiers.

721
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,491
<i>He's going to be ordained
himself, you see.</i>

722
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,492
- Oh?
- <i>Mm.</i>

723
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,661
And how is that going for him?

724
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:54,733
You'll be pleased to know
that he hasn't helped

725
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,068
a certain conscript escape.

726
00:39:10,382 --> 00:39:12,451
But I do want to do something
for him, Bree.

727
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,621
You listen to your instincts.

728
00:39:16,621 --> 00:39:17,923
I have to be able to listen to mine.

729
00:39:19,091 --> 00:39:20,492
So I'm going to help Wendigo...

730
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:22,794
<i>by praying for him.</i>

731
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:29,668
Go on, then.

732
00:39:30,802 --> 00:39:32,738
Do it now if it'll make you feel better.

733
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,818
Lord, it is said that God helps those

734
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:49,621
who help themselves.

735
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:52,124
I always found that confusing.

736
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:56,595
Like those who help themselves
to the last slice of cake,

737
00:39:57,863 --> 00:39:58,764
or...

738
00:40:05,871 --> 00:40:07,639
Lord, please help Wendigo Donner,

739
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,843
or at least help him to help himself.

740
00:40:19,684 --> 00:40:21,553
You're going to be a great minister.

741
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:29,628
You'll never be able
to recruit enough men.

742
00:40:30,162 --> 00:40:31,663
I willna be recruitin' men.

743
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,032
But I am goin' back to that ship.

744
00:40:34,833 --> 00:40:36,168
What will you do, Uncle?

745
00:40:37,569 --> 00:40:38,470
Whatever I must.

746
00:40:43,508 --> 00:40:45,076
You should go back to the Ridge.

747
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:47,212
I dinna want ye involved.

748
00:40:47,212 --> 00:40:48,446
What d'ye mean?

749
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,147
<i>Fraser.</i>

750
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,518
Tom.

751
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:56,021
Is that a whisky in yer hand?

752
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,891
I have wrestled with my demons.

753
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,128
But it's you.

754
00:41:04,529 --> 00:41:05,230
It's always you.

755
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,900
You are the answer to my prayer.

756
00:41:09,868 --> 00:41:11,636
How much have ye had to drink?

757
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:13,839
You must help me.

758
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:16,808
I beg you.

759
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,611
There is something I must do.

760
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,753
Some air to clear yer heid.

761
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,056
Ye're not accustomed to it.

762
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,490
Whisky's addled yer wits.

763
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:46,104
Over the years,
I've watched men come to you

764
00:41:46,104 --> 00:41:47,172
and ask for your help.

765
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,708
You never turn them away.

766
00:41:50,942 --> 00:41:52,043
Will you refuse me now?

767
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:54,045
Let me go to the <i>Cruizer.</i>

768
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:57,249
Let me tell the governor what I have done.

769
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,752
Let me look Mistress Fraser in the eye

770
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:02,020
one last time and confess.

771
00:42:08,226 --> 00:42:10,061
On our wedding day, I swore to Claire

772
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,198
she'd have the protection of my name,

773
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:14,900
my clan, my family,

774
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:18,803
and the protection of my...

775
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,105
my body as well.

776
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:24,542
I will honor that promise.

777
00:42:26,278 --> 00:42:27,545
I dinna need yer help.

778
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,816
I believe that in letting me go to her,

779
00:42:33,752 --> 00:42:35,820
you will honor that promise just the same,

780
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:37,756
just as you've honored the promises made

781
00:42:37,756 --> 00:42:39,257
to those of us who were at Ardsmuir.

782
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:44,996
I have no name

783
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,800
that carries any weight in this world.

784
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:51,202
A broken family.

785
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:54,072
No clan of my own.

786
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,044
Allow me to do this.

787
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,289
I can say nothin' to dissuade ye?

788
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:14,893
No.

789
00:43:33,244 --> 00:43:34,346
Send Claire back to me.

790
00:43:46,324 --> 00:43:47,625
That blackened day...

791
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:51,029
Mistress Fraser told us

792
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:54,733
what she would have said
about Malva at her funeral.

793
00:43:57,936 --> 00:43:59,004
I won't have a eulogy,

794
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:01,773
and I don't know
what sort of burial awaits me.

795
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:02,674
But...

796
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,712
...I do wonder what you
might have said about me.

797
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:09,714
- Tom...
- Please.

798
00:44:24,195 --> 00:44:25,263
I would say that Thomas Christie

799
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:26,664
was an honorable Scot...

800
00:44:29,134 --> 00:44:30,068
<i>...a leader of men</i>

801
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,670
<i>in his own way,</i>

802
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,741
though he didna ken
quite where to lead them.

803
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:43,748
Stubborn as a damned mule...

804
00:44:45,884 --> 00:44:47,419
...but despite our differences,

805
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:51,189
a man I respected

806
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,360
and whose respect I hope I had in return.

807
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:06,905
<i>Boat, ahoy!</i>

808
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,391
<i>Jamie said he was coming back.</i>

809
00:45:27,025 --> 00:45:28,059
<i>You will see him presently.</i>

810
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,794
He awaits you in Wilmington.

811
00:45:29,894 --> 00:45:31,162
What the hell is going on?

812
00:45:38,002 --> 00:45:40,338
I've come to confess
to the murder of my daughter.

813
00:45:41,339 --> 00:45:42,240
No.

814
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,375
No, you couldn't have.

815
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:46,311
Still contrary, I see.

816
00:45:47,212 --> 00:45:49,180
- Are you insane?
- <i>It's the truth.</i>

817
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:51,282
I will swear to it by the Holy Scriptures.

818
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:54,886
I...

819
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,457
I don't understand.

820
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:03,962
Do you remember once,

821
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,165
you asked me if I thought you a witch?

822
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:10,168
You said you didn't think I was one.

823
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:11,369
No. But I have known them.

824
00:46:13,204 --> 00:46:14,806
The girl was one. So was her mother.

825
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:19,277
"The girl" was your daughter, Malva.

826
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,116
No daughter of mine.

827
00:46:26,451 --> 00:46:28,853
- Mr. Christie--
- <i>She was my brother's.</i>

828
00:46:31,222 --> 00:46:32,123
Edgar.

829
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,028
When the Rising came, I...

830
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:40,798
declared for the Stuarts.

831
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,802
He would have none of it,
saying it was folly. He...

832
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:47,105
He begged me not to go.

833
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,976
I asked him to look after
my wife and wee Allan.

834
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:52,877
And he did.

835
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:56,014
He certainly did.

836
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,051
I see.

837
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,353
<i>It wasn't his fault.</i>

838
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:03,454
Mona was a witch,

839
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,224
an enchantress.

840
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,959
<i>And he succumbed to her.</i>

841
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,597
<i>I see you don't believe me,
but it is the truth.</i>

842
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:14,566
More than once, I caught her at it,

843
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,335
working her charms
and staring at the stars,

844
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:20,438
her hair flying loose, mad in the wind.

845
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:25,610
She had hair like mine, didn't she?

846
00:47:26,477 --> 00:47:27,378
<i>Leave it.</i>

847
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:34,319
<i>I tried to save her by prayer,
by God's grace.</i>

848
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:36,621
<i>I could not.</i>

849
00:47:37,589 --> 00:47:40,191
She was eventually hanged
for the murder of my brother.

850
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,394
So you sent for Allan and Malva.

851
00:47:44,229 --> 00:47:46,564
By the time she came to me,
Malva already had it,

852
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:48,199
the same slyness, the charm,

853
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,168
the same darkness of soul as her mother.

854
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,874
<i>I tried to keep her from
working her wiles upon men.</i>

855
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,545
<i>It was the curse of Lilith
that they had, both of them.</i>

856
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,615
She was with child.

857
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:05,483
<i>I do not think it wrong</i>

858
00:48:05,483 --> 00:48:08,219
to prevent yet another witch
from entering the world.

859
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,922
<i>You know she tried to kill you?</i>

860
00:48:11,289 --> 00:48:12,190
<i>You and me both.</i>

861
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,525
You can't be certain of that.

862
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:16,427
It was you who told me that we suffered

863
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:18,596
with the same illness
during the flux at the Ridge.

864
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,665
<i>You told her about the invisible things,</i>

865
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,566
<i>the--the germs.</i>

866
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:24,369
<i>She confessed when I caught her</i>

867
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,903
<i>with the Sin-Eater's bones.</i>

868
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,172
She'd made a broth to poison us with.

869
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,610
Love charm.

870
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,414
She wanted Jamie.

871
00:48:37,382 --> 00:48:39,350
She lusted after wealth, position.

872
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:44,689
Or what she saw as freedom.

873
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,694
Do you know who
the baby's father really was?

874
00:48:54,432 --> 00:48:56,534
I could not let her destroy so many lives,

875
00:48:56,534 --> 00:48:57,535
for she was a witch.

876
00:48:57,535 --> 00:48:58,936
Make no mistake.

877
00:48:59,037 --> 00:48:59,637
She would have killed someone

878
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:00,705
<i>before she finished.</i>

879
00:49:02,206 --> 00:49:04,208
So you decided to bear that cross for her?

880
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:08,112
She was not born of my loins,

881
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:09,414
and yet she was my daughter,

882
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,549
my blood.

883
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:13,351
I am responsible.

884
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:19,724
I don't believe you, Tom.

885
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,297
I have waited all my life

886
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:30,368
in search of...

887
00:49:30,368 --> 00:49:31,369
no, in hope of a thing

888
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,641
I could not name but I knew must exist.

889
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:42,180
I was convinced it was God I sought,

890
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:46,384
but the love of God alone
could not sustain me.

891
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:48,553
No.

892
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:51,723
Now I know

893
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:53,991
that I...

894
00:49:56,761 --> 00:49:57,662
...I love you.

895
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:13,578
<i>Here, now...</i>

896
00:50:16,314 --> 00:50:18,082
I have written down my confession.

897
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,389
I have sworn that I killed my daughter

898
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,393
for the shame she had brought
on me by her wantonness.

899
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,731
- No.
- I have written another copy

900
00:50:34,232 --> 00:50:36,300
of this confession
and have already left it

901
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:38,069
with the newspaper in Wilmington.

902
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:41,806
<i>They will publish it,
and you will go free.</i>

903
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:47,345
I have yearned always for love,

904
00:50:49,514 --> 00:50:50,515
given and returned.

905
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,452
I've spent my life
in the attempt to give my love

906
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,755
to those who are not worthy of it.

907
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,559
<i>Allow me this...</i>

908
00:51:05,163 --> 00:51:07,265
...to give my life
for the sake of one who is.

909
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:13,371
Your life has value.

910
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:18,142
<i>You can't throw it away like this.</i>

911
00:51:21,345 --> 00:51:22,246
I know that.

912
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,756
If I did not, then this would not matter.

913
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:35,259
Go to your husband.

914
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:41,466
There must be something we can do.

915
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:42,333
Lieutenant Tate...

916
00:51:43,468 --> 00:51:44,368
I'm ready now.

917
00:52:46,764 --> 00:52:48,165
Did you make Tom confess?

918
00:52:51,202 --> 00:52:51,903
No.

919
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,673
No, he--he told me what he intended to do,

920
00:52:56,574 --> 00:52:57,542
and I told him bide.

921
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:02,914
I did tell him that I'd have another go

922
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:05,883
at trying to get you back,
but he--he insisted.

923
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,655
So you don't think he did it either?

924
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,593
He only said he stayed silent
while there was any chance

925
00:53:15,593 --> 00:53:17,328
of you bein' tried and acquitted,

926
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:18,863
but...

927
00:53:22,366 --> 00:53:24,335
...had you ever been in any urgent danger,

928
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,636
he'd have spoken up at once.

929
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,973
That's why he insisted on
coming wi' us to Wilmington.

930
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:31,375
But that doesn't make any sense.

931
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,845
Why didn't he speak up in front of Brown?

932
00:53:35,913 --> 00:53:37,315
I wondered if it was Brown

933
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:39,584
who killed Malva himself,

934
00:53:39,584 --> 00:53:40,918
but... lookin' for revenge.

935
00:53:43,721 --> 00:53:44,622
Maybe.

936
00:53:48,859 --> 00:53:50,728
I just can't believe it was Tom.

937
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,930
Tell me he didn't make
that confession for me.

938
00:54:00,438 --> 00:54:01,339
He loves you.

939
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,809
It's plain to see, Sassenach.

940
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,779
I'd have done the same,

941
00:54:10,815 --> 00:54:12,817
counted my life well lost if it saved you.

942
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,625
But how can I let him
sacrifice himself for me?

943
00:54:24,295 --> 00:54:25,830
They're going to hang him, Jamie.

944
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,531
If he feels the same as me,

945
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:29,400
then you've done no wrong to him

946
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,470
to take your life from his hand.

947
00:54:35,373 --> 00:54:36,374
It's what he wanted.

948
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,713
Rest now, <i>mo chridhe.</i>

949
00:55:47,912 --> 00:55:49,013
<i>I saw your horse.</i>

950
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,348
I'd know him anywhere.

951
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,818
Stared at his arse for 200 miles.

952
00:55:59,056 --> 00:55:59,957
So...

953
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:02,860
you didn't fancy a trip

954
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,596
back to bonnie Scotland then,
eh, Mr. Fraser?

955
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,572
No.

956
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:20,644
<i>No, thank ye.</i>

957
00:56:21,145 --> 00:56:22,913
I'd prefer to wait until after.

958
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:27,852
"After"?

959
00:56:30,988 --> 00:56:31,889
Come now.

960
00:56:33,924 --> 00:56:35,126
You harm a hair on my head,

961
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,597
you know my kin will hunt you down,

962
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,999
<i>kill everyone you hold dear.</i>

963
00:56:43,901 --> 00:56:45,603
I've spared them the trouble.

964
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,474
By now, my nephew,

965
00:56:52,877 --> 00:56:54,078
the Indian ye tormented,

966
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:57,548
will be payin' yer men a wee visit.

967
00:56:59,617 --> 00:57:01,619
His Cherokee acquaintances
will be giving him

968
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,586
a helping hand too.

969
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,105
We'll have no more trouble from them.

970
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:29,880
You're a good man.

971
00:57:33,117 --> 00:57:34,018
A moral man.

972
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:37,454
I'm also a violent man.

973
00:57:40,524 --> 00:57:42,059
Any goodness that prevails in me

974
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:43,127
is because of my wife.

975
00:57:46,163 --> 00:57:47,698
You tried to take her from me.

976
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,035
You won't kill me.

977
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:55,105
Not in cold blood.

978
00:57:58,642 --> 00:57:59,610
You wouldn't dare.

979
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:02,813
Make your peace with the Lord
if you must...

980
00:58:04,648 --> 00:58:05,549
Mr. Brown.
